Image Data
==========

The example (code) is available `here <https://github.com/gutfeeling/langsearch/tree/main/examples/local_images>`_
for your inspection.

To run the code, first download the `image files <https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/5obsit7ybacowtn3bi2sp/h?rlkey=dvfau50vs98hofmajtu421b1c&dl=0>`_
and place them in the ``bulksplash`` folder.

Then, follow the same steps as in the :doc:`quickstart guide <quickstart>` to search for images using text.
