Audio Data
==========

The example (code) is available `here <https://github.com/gutfeeling/langsearch/tree/main/examples/local_audio>`_
for your inspection.

To run the code, first download the `video files <https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/6pkby6lftpo1baa1vwa9f/h?rlkey=sra0d0mhmjfjb1bn5kbva77o3&dl=0>`_
and place them in the ``deeprl_course_videos`` folder.

Then, follow the same steps as in the :doc:`quickstart guide <quickstart>` to run the crawler and perform Q & A based on the audio
data.
