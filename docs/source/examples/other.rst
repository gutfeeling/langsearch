PDF, DOCX & co
==============

The example (code) is available `here <https://github.com/gutfeeling/langsearch/tree/main/examples/local_files>`_
for your inspection. This looks into code files and a PDF.

To run the code, first download the `PDF file <https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ib3xn56hfubu15y2gvr43/h?rlkey=qxx8qfemo4ozdv6xh086qkz2k&dl=0>`_
and place them in the ``langsearch_docs`` folder.

Then, follow the same steps as in the :doc:`quickstart guide <quickstart>` to search for images using text.
